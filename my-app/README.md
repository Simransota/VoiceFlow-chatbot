# Immersive Chat Experience - Frontend Developer Intern Challenge

## Overview

This project aims to recreate an immersive chat experience inspired by the video provided by South Digital and VoiceFlow. It enhances the interaction by incorporating additional features such as voice input, a pixel trail effect, and a 3D image cube for user interaction.

## Features

- **Voice Input**: Users can interact with the chat interface using voice commands, making the experience more natural and immersive.
- **Pixel Trail**: A visual effect that adds a dynamic pixel trail following user interactions, enhancing the overall aesthetic and engagement.
- **3D Image Cube**: A rotating 3D cube incorporated into the chat interface that allows users to interact with the UI in a more playful and engaging way.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js (or any framework of choice)
- **Voice Input**: Web Speech API / SpeechRecognition API
- **Animations**: CSS3, Three.js (for 3D Cube)
- **Pixel Trail Effect**: Custom JavaScript or CSS for animation effects
- **Design**: Figma (for wireframes, UI elements, and interaction designs)

## Installation

To get started with the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

    ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features in Detail

### 1. **Voice Input**
   - The chat system allows users to interact via voice commands.
   - Utilizes the Web Speech API or SpeechRecognition API to convert speech into text that is sent as chat input.
   - Ensures a seamless, hands-free interaction experience.

### 2. **Pixel Trail**
   - A pixel trail effect follows the mouse movements, providing a visually engaging experience.
   - Custom animations are triggered based on user interaction, adding more depth to the interface.

### 3. **3D Image Cube**
   - A 3D interactive cube is embedded in the chat interface.
   - The cube rotates based on user actions and can display various dynamic content.
   - Three.js is used to create a realistic and smooth 3D interaction.

## Design Process

The design focused on enhancing user interaction with the chat interface. Key design considerations include:

- **Fluid and engaging UI/UX**: Ensuring smooth animations, minimal lag, and intuitive interactions.
- **Immersive Experience**: Using voice input and dynamic animations (pixel trail and 3D cube) to engage users and provide an interactive environment.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring all elements are easily navigable via both mouse and keyboard, with voice as an alternative input method.

## Code Quality & Best Practices

The project adheres to modern web development practices:

- **Modular and reusable components**: The React.js components are structured to be reusable and easy to maintain.
- **Clean, readable code**: Ensures scalability and ease of understanding.
- **Detailed comments**: Each section of the code is well-commented to explain the logic and functionality.

## Bonus Features

- **Innovative Design**: The 3D cube is integrated in a way that it responds to user input and adds a dynamic element to the chat interface.
- **Animations**: Various animations are incorporated, like pixel trails and smooth transitions, that give life to the chat experience.
